def play_offloading_game(server_selected, b_old, prices, k, l, a, b_max, b_min, **params):
    '''
    Users play the offloading game to find their best response based on what
    the other users played.

    Parameters
    ----------

    server_selected: 1-D array
        list containing the server to which each user is associated
    b_old: 1-D array
        offloading data each user had decided to send on the previous
        iteration
    prices: 1-D array
        Set the new prices of the servers
    k: int
        parameter of the user's satisfaction function
    l: int
        parameter of the user's satisfaction function
    a: 1-D array
        parameter that reflects users' dynamic behavior to spen more money
        in order to buy computing support from the MEC servers
    b_min: int
        Minimum number of bits that the user is willing to offload
        Same for all users
    b_max: int
        Maximum number of bits that the user is willing to offload
        Same for all users

    Returns
    -------

    b: 1-D array
        offloading data each user has decided to send on the current
        iteration

    fs: 1-D array
        parameter that shows the server's discount
